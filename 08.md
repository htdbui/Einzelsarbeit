- **Review of Previous Lecture (Seventh Lecture Unit)**
  - Repeated the definition of $\ddot{a}_x$ (the famous $\ddot{a}_x$).
  - Main theorem: The difference between the yearly-defined $\ddot{a}_x$ and the "during the year" defined $\ddot{a}_x$ is a correction term, which is independent of $H_x$.
  - Introduced computation symbols: capital $D$'s and $N$'s.
    - $N_x = \sum_{k=0}^{z-x-1} D_{x+k}$
    - $\ddot{a}_x = N_x / D_x$
    - Motivation for computation symbols: allows annuity present values to be written in terms of quotients of $N$ and $D$.
    - Computation list columns: ages (yearly/discrete), mortalities, $D_x$, $N_x$, etc.

- **Section 3.2: Several Present Value Factors of Annuities**
  - **Definitions of Expected Present Value Factors (EPVF, ePVF)**
    - First (theoretically defined): Annuity for active employees (salary + annuity).
      - Not used in practice, but important for later calculations.
    - Disability annuity: $\ddot{a}_x^i$
    - Retirement annuity: $\ddot{a}_x^r$
    - Deferred retirement annuity (active person)
    - Deferred retirement annuity (disabled person)
    - Lifelong disability annuity: can be split into deferred and cut versions.
      - Main theorem: Difference between monthly-paid and yearly-paid is a correction term.
    - Widow annuity
    - Prospective entitlement annuities:
      - $\ddot{a}_x^{rw}$
      - Fourfold definition:
        - $\ddot{a}_x^{rw}$ defined by $N_x^{rw}$
        - $N_x^{rw}$ by sum of $D_{x+h}^{rw}$
        - $D_x^{rw}$ by further definitions
        - Issues: discount factor not linear; $y_x + 1/2$ not a natural number; resolved using invariant theorem.
      - **Noberg's Invariant Theorem**: If both the trigger event and terminating event are uniformly distributed over the year, monthly and yearly values are equal.
    - $\ddot{a}_x^{ai}$ (prospective entitlement, lifelong disability, active employee):
      - Definition analogously to 3.2.8:
        - $\ddot{a}_x^{ai} = N_x^{ai} / D_x^a$
        - $N_x^{ai} = \sum_{k=0}^{z-x-1} D_{x+k}^{ai}$
        - $D_x^{ai} = D_x^a \cdot i_x \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}p_{x+\frac{1}{2}}^i \cdot v \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+1}^{i}$
        - Issues:
          - Discounting is multiplicative, not linear, due to $x + \frac{1}{2}$ not a natural number.
          - Must define $\ddot{a}_{x+\frac{1}{2}}^i$:
            - $\ddot{a}_{x+\frac{1}{2}}^i = {}_{\frac{1}{2}}p_{x+\frac{1}{2}}^i \cdot v^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+1}^{i}$
          - Discounting back 6 months handled via $v^{\frac{1}{2}}$.
          - Final $D_x^{ai}$: $D_x^a \cdot i_x \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}p_{x+\frac{1}{2}}^i \cdot v \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+1}^{i}$.
      - Argument: Monthly and yearly values are equal when invariance theorem applies.

  - **Introduction of Capital $S$ Symbols**
    - Motivation: In Germany, many companies promise "dynamical annuities" (linear increase of annuity amount per year).
      - Each year, the aggregate annuity increases by 1€, with the last increase at age $z-1$.
      - For $h \geq z$, no further increase; amount becomes stable.
    - Definition:
      - $\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_x^{ai} = \frac{S_x^{ai}}{D_x^a}$
      - $S_x^{ai} = \sum_{k=0}^{z-x-1} N_{x+k}^{ai}$
      - $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq z-1}$
      - $S_x^a = \sum_{k=0}^{z-x-1} N_{x+k}^a$
      - $N_x^a = \sum_{k=0}^{z-x-1} D_{x+k}^a$
    - Interpretation of $S_x$:
      - $\frac{S_x^a}{D_x^a} = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{z-x-1} N_{x+k}^a}{D_x^a}$
        - $= \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{z-x-1} \sum_{l=0}^{z-x-1} D_{(x+k)+l}^a}{D_x^a}$
        - $= \frac{D_x^a + 2D_{x+1}^a + 3D_{x+2}^a + \ldots + (Z-x)D_{Z-1}^a}{D_x^a}$
        - $= 1 + 2 \cdot \frac{D_{x+1}^a}{D_x^a} + 3 \cdot \frac{D_{x+2}^a}{D_x^a} + \ldots + (Z-x) \cdot \frac{D_{Z-1}^a}{D_x^a}$
        - Each $\frac{D_{x+k}^a}{D_x^a} = {}_k p_x \cdot v^k$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$
      - Final form:
        - $= 1 + 2 \cdot p_x \cdot v + 3 \cdot {}_2p_x \cdot v^2 + \ldots + (Z-x) \cdot {}_{Z-x-1}p_x \cdot v^{Z-x-1}$
        - Interpreted as: 1€ at first payout, 2€ (if survive one year), discounted, etc.
      - $S_x$ is only applied for $\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_x$ because of Neuburger's invariance theorem.
      - For monthly payments: $^{(12)}\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_x^{ai} \neq \overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_x^{ai}$ (due to violation of invariance theorem).

  - **3.2.10: Prospective Entitlement of Disabled Person for Widow Annuity**
    - For $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq Z-1}$:

      - $N_x^{iw} := \sum_{h=0}^{Z-x-1} D_{x+h}^{iw} + D_z^i \cdot \ddot{a}_z^{rw}$
      - $D_x^{iw} := D_x^i \cdot q_x^i \cdot h(x) \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}p_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}^w \cdot v^{\frac{1}{2}} \cdot \ddot{a}_{y(x)+1}^w \cdot v^{\frac{1}{2}}$

      - $\hat{N_{x+k}^{aiA}} := N_x^{ai} + D_z^a \cdot {}^{(12)}\ddot{a}_z^r$

      - $D_x^{aaw} := D_x^a \cdot q_x^{aa} \cdot h(x) \cdot \ddot{a}_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}^w \cdot v^{\frac{1}{2}} = D_x^a \cdot q_x^{aa} \cdot h(x) \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}p_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}^w \cdot \ddot{a}_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}^w \cdot v$

  - **3.2.13: Prospective Entitlement of Active Employee for Widow Annuity if Married Employee Will Die as Disabled**
    - $\ddot{a}_x^{aiw} := \frac{N_x^{aiw}}{D_x^a}$
      - Replace "a" by "i" in 3.2.12
    - For monthly payments:
      - ${}^{(12)}\ddot{a}_x^{aiw} = \ddot{a}_x^{aaw}$
      - ${}^{(12)}\ddot{a}_x^{aiw} = \ddot{a}_x^{aiw}$

      - $S_x^{ai(z)} := \sum_{k=0}^{Z-x-1} N_{x+k}^{ai(z)}$
    - Invariance theorem does not apply, because the terminating event is not uniformly distributed (deterministic at retirement age).

- **Section 3.3: Invariance Theorem of Neuburger**
  - Statement:
    - Present value factors of prospective annuities with stable yearly aggregate amounts and deterministic payout time points are independent of the payout order if both the trigger event and the terminating event are uniformly distributed over the year.
    - For monthly payments:
      - ${}^{(12)}\ddot{a}_x^{ai} = \ddot{a}_x^{ai}$
      - ${}^{(12)}\ddot{a}_x^{aw} = \ddot{a}_x^{aw}$
      - ${}^{(12)}\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_x^{ai} \neq \overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_x^{ai}$
      - ${}^{(12)}\ddot{a}_x^{r} \neq \ddot{a}_x^{r}$
        - $\ddot{a}_x^{r} = {}^{(12)}\ddot{a}_x^{r} + k(12)$
      - ${}^{(12)}\ddot{a}_x^{ai(z)} \neq \ddot{a}_x^{ai(z)}$
    - Independence means that the expected present value is the same regardless of whether payment is yearly or monthly, as long as both events are uniformly distributed.
    - Examples where the theorem applies:
      - Lifelong disability annuity (trigger: disability, terminate: death, both assumed uniformly distributed)
      - Widow annuity (trigger: death of active employee, terminate: death of widow, both assumed uniformly distributed)
    - Examples where the theorem does not apply:
      - Dynamical/increasing annuities: stable aggregate assumption violated.
      - Cut disability annuity: terminating event is deterministic (retirement age).

- **Remarks**
  - Each of the 15 present value factors is distinct; no general formula covers all.
  - Definitions, symbols, and their relationships are important for exams.
  - Complexity is high; step-by-step definition is necessary.
  - Notation and typesetting challenges for certain symbols (e.g., increasing symbol above annuity notation).
