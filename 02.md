## 2. Mathematical Basics of Pension Insurance

### 2.1 The Simple Leaving-Order Model

#### 2.1.1 Model Setup and Assumptions

- Only one leaving reason is considered (e.g., death, disability, or switching to a new company).
- Let $(\Omega, \sigma, \mathbb{P})$ be a probability space.
- Remarks:
  - (i) It is assumed that leaving the company because of death, disability, or switching to a new company depends on the age of the employee.
  - (ii) A disabled or dead person will not return to the employer.
- Ages:
  - Continuous case: $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^+$
  - Discrete case: $x, y \in \mathbb{N}_0$
- Random variable $T: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ models the timepoint of leaving the set of active employees.
- $t^*$ is the timepoint of birth of the considered employee.
- $g = \lfloor t^* \rfloor = \max\{z \in \mathbb{Z} \mid z \leq t^*\}$ is the floor of the timepoint of birth.
  - Examples: $\lfloor 3.1 \rfloor = 3$, $\lfloor -3.1 \rfloor = -4$

#### 2.1.2 Key Random Variables and Definitions

- $X = T - t^*$: random variable modeling the age of the employee when leaving the set of active persons.
  - Interpretation: $X$ is the age at which the employee leaves the employer.
- W.l.o.g., assume $x \in \mathbb{N}_0$ (discrete ages).
  - One-year leaving probability: $q_x = \mathbb{P}(X \leq x+1 \mid X > x)$
    - In the case of leaving by death, $q_x$ is called the mortality.
  - Anti-probability (surviving): $p_x = 1 - q_x = \mathbb{P}(X > x+1 \mid X > x)$
  - $l_x = \mathbb{P}(X > x)$: probability of being still active at age $x$.

#### 2.1.3 Lemma: Relationship Between Survival Probabilities

- For all $x \in \mathbb{N}_0$:
  - $\frac{l_{x+1}}{l_x} = p_x$
- Proof:
  - $p_x l_x = \mathbb{P}(X > x+1 \mid X > x) \mathbb{P}(X > x) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X > x+1, X > x)}{\mathbb{P}(X > x)} \mathbb{P}(X > x) = \mathbb{P}(X > x+1) = l_{x+1}$

#### 2.1.4 Theoretical Human End Age

- $\omega \in \mathbb{N}$ is defined as the theoretical human end age, set to $121$ (the age of the oldest known human).
- $l_x$ is defined as:
  - $0$ if $x \geq \omega$
  - $1$ if $x = 0$
  - Positive real number in $(0,1)$ if $x < \omega$
- $x \in \mathbb{N}_0$

#### 2.1.5 Generalized Conditional Probabilities

- For $s \in \mathbb{R}^+, x \in \mathbb{N}_0$:
  - ${}_s q_x = \mathbb{P}(X \leq x+s \mid X > x)$
  - ${}_s p_x = 1 - {}_s q_x = \mathbb{P}(X > x+s \mid X > x)$
- Remark:
  - Analogue to the earlier lemma, $\frac{l_{x+s}}{l_x} = {}_s p_x$

#### 2.1.6 Definition and Interpretation of the Random Variable $S$

- $S: \Omega \rightarrow [0,1]$, defined as $S = X - \lfloor X \rfloor$
  - Interpretation: $S$ is the time-interval from the beginning of the year of leaving until the actual leaving time within that year.
  - Example: An active employee gets disabled at July 1st ($01.07$); $S = 6/12 = 0.5$.

#### 2.1.7 Main Theorem: Linear Factorization of Under-the-Year Leaving Probabilities

- For all $u \in (0,1)$ and for all $x \in \mathbb{N}_0$:
  - ${}_u q_x = u q_x$
    - ${}_u q_x$: probability that an $x$-year-old employee leaves in the next $u$ years.
    - $u q_x$: the product of the fraction of the year and the one-year leaving probability.

##### Proof Outline

- $\mathbb{P}(S \leq u \mid \lfloor X \rfloor = x) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(S \leq u; \lfloor X \rfloor = x)}{\mathbb{P}(\lfloor X \rfloor = x)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(x < X \leq x+u)}{\mathbb{P}(x < X \leq x+1)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X \leq x+u \mid X > x) \mathbb{P}(X > x)}{\mathbb{P}(X \leq x+1 \mid X > x) \mathbb{P}(X > x)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X \leq x+u \mid X > x)}{\mathbb{P}(X \leq x+1 \mid X > x)} = \frac{{}_u q_x}{q_x}$
- Independence of $S$ and $\lfloor X \rfloor$: $\mathbb{P}(S \leq u \mid \lfloor X \rfloor = x) = \mathbb{P}(S \leq u)$
- $S$ is uniformly distributed: $S \sim U(0,1)$, so $\mathbb{P}(S \leq u) = u$
- Therefore, ${}_u q_x = u q_x$

##### Detailed discussion on Uniform Distribution $U(a, b)$

- $U(0,1)$ is called the continuous uniform distribution.
- In general, $U(a, b)$:
  - $a, b$ real numbers, $a < b$
  - Distribution function:
    - $F(x) = 0$ if $x \leq a$
    - $F(x) = 1$ if $x \geq b$
    - $F(x) = \frac{x-a}{b-a}$ if $a < x < b$
  - Density function: $f(x) = \frac{dF}{dx} = \frac{1}{b-a}$ for $a < x < b$, 0 otherwise.
  - Expected value: $\mathbb{E}(x) = \frac{a+b}{2}$
  - Variance: $\text{var}(x) = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$
- For $S \sim U(0,1)$:
  - $\mathbb{P}(S \le u) = F(u) = u$
  - $\mathbb{E}(S) = \frac{1}{2}$
  - $\text{var}(S) = \frac{1}{12}$
  - Calculations:
    - $\mathbb{E}(S) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} S f(S) dS = \int_{0}^{1} S dS = [\frac{S^2}{2}]_0^1 = \frac{1}{2}$
    - $\mathbb{E}(S^2) = \int_{0}^{1} S^2 dS = [\frac{S^3}{3}]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3}$
    - $\text{var}(S) = \mathbb{E}(S^2) - (\mathbb{E}(S))^2 = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{12}$

#### 2.1.8 Application to Mortality Tables

- A mortality table is a list of all $q_x$ for $x \in \mathbb{N}_0$.
- Example calculation: ${}_{6/12}q_{20} = \frac{1}{2} q_{20}$
  - To find the probability that a 20-year-old dies in the next 6 months, multiply the one-year mortality by $1/2$.
- ${}_0q_x = 0$ and ${}_0p_x = 1$.

#### 2.1.9 Remarks on Anti-probabilities

- ${}_u p_x \neq u p_x$ for all $u \in (0,1)$ and $x \in \mathbb{N}_0$.
  - $u p_x$ is not the correct formula for the probability of surviving a fraction of a year.
- It is sufficient to consider ${}_{1/2}q_x$ and ${}_{1/2}p_x$ because $\mathbb{E}(S) = 1/2$.
  - The expected value of $S$ (remaining time in the year of leaving) is $1/2$, so the expected time of leaving is at $x + 1/2$.

#### 2.1.10 Multi-Year Survival and Leaving Probabilities

- For $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$, the $n$-year survival probability is:
  - ${}_n p_x = \prod_{j=1}^{n} p_{x + j - 1} = \prod_{j=1}^{n} (1 - q_{x + j - 1})$
- The $n$-year leaving probability is:
  - ${}_n q_x = 1 - {}_n p_x$

#### 2.1.11 Survival Probabilities for Non-integer Ages

- For $x \in \mathbb{N}_0$:
  - ${}_{1/2} p_{x + 1/2} = \frac{1 - q_x}{1 - \frac{1}{2} q_x}$
- Proof:
  - ${}_1 p_x = {}_{1/2} p_x \cdot {}_{1/2} p_{x + 1/2}$
  - So, ${}_{1/2} p_{x + 1/2} = \frac{p_x}{{}_{1/2} p_x} = \frac{1 - q_x}{1 - {}_{1/2} q_x} = \frac{1 - q_x}{1 - \frac{1}{2} q_x}$
- Remark:
  - We can express $p_x, {}_{1/2} p_x, {}_{1/2} p_{x + 1/2}, {}_{1/2} q_{x + 1/2}$, etc., using only the one-year leaving probability $q_x$ for $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq \omega} \cup \{0\}$.

#### 2.1.12 Lemma and Corollary

- Lemma: ${}_{1/2} p_{x + 1/2}$
  - $p_x = {}_{1/2} p_x \cdot {}_{1/2} p_{x + 1/2}$
  - ${}_{1/2} p_{x + 1/2} = \frac{1 - q_x}{1 - \frac{1}{2} q_x}$
- Corollary: ${}_{1/2} q_{x + 1/2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} q_x}{1 - \frac{1}{2} q_x}$
  - Proof: ${}_{1/2} q_{x + 1/2} = 1 - {}_{1/2} p_{x + 1/2} = 1 - \frac{1 - q_x}{1 - \frac{1}{2} q_x} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} q_x}{1 - \frac{1}{2} q_x}$

### 2.2 The Compound Leaving Order Model

#### 2.2.1 Model Setup and Assumptions

- $h$ is the number of random leaving reasons.
- Assumptions:
  - (1) Never come back rule: Once an employee leaves for any reason, they do not return.
  - (2) Only one reason is responsible for leaving the active set at any time.
- Define random variables on $(\Omega, \sigma, \mathbb{P})$:
  - $T_i: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ for $i \in \{1, ..., h\}$
    - $T_i$ is the timepoint when the considered employee leaves because of reason $i$.
  - $X_i = T_i - t^*$: age at leaving because of reason $i$.
  - $X = \min\{X_i \mid 1 \leq i \leq h\}$: age of first leaving.
  - $U = \min\{i \mid X_i = X\}$: the first leaving is due to reason $i$.

#### 2.2.2 Compound Leaving Probabilities

- $q_x^{(i)} = \mathbb{P}(X \leq x+1, U = i \mid X > x)$
- $q_x = \mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^h \{X_i \leq x+1\} \mid \bigcap_{i=1}^h \{X_i > x\}\right)$

#### 2.2.3 Special Case: $h = 2$ (Death and Disability)

- Focus: $h = 2$; reasons are death and disability.

### 2.3 Leaving Order of the RT 2005 G-model (Richttafeln 2005 Generation Model)

#### 2.3.1 Model Setup for RT 2005 G-model

- $h = 2$; leaving reasons: death ($i=2$) and disability ($i=1$).
- Main set: set of active employees of one company.
- Retirement age $z$:
  - $z = 65$ (as used in DAV exam)
  - $z = 67$ (as per law; deterministic, not random)

#### 2.3.2 Definitions

- For $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq z-1}$:
  - $i_x = q_x^{(1)}$: one-year disability probability (probability that an active $x$-year-old employee becomes disabled during the next year).
    - Notation: $i$ from German "invalid" (disabled).
  - $q_x^{aa} = q_x^{(2)}$: probability that an active $x$-year-old employee will die as active during the next year.
    - First $a$: start as active; second $a$: die as active.

#### 2.3.3 Disabled Employees as Main Set

- Main set: all disabled employees of a company.
- Only one leaving reason: death ($h = 1$), since disabled employees are assumed not able to switch to another company.
- $q_x^{(1)} = q_x^i$: probability that a $x$-year-old disabled employee will die during the next year.
- $p_x^i = 1 - q_x^i$: probability that a $x$-year-old disabled employee survives until $x + 1$.

#### 2.3.4 Notation and Probability Definitions

- Notation due to Prof. Heubeck for pension insurance.
- $q_x^i = \mathbb{P}(X_2 \leq x+1 \mid X_1 \leq x, X_2 > x)$: probability that a $x$-year-old disabled employee will die in the next year.
- In case $h = 2$, define two random variables:
  - $X_1$: age when becoming disabled
  - $X_2$: age of death
- $i_x = \mathbb{P}(X_1 \leq x+1, X_1 \leq X_2 \mid X_1 > x, X_2 > x)$: probability that a $x$-year-old active employee becomes disabled next year.
- $q_x^{aa} = \mathbb{P}(X_2 \leq x+1, X_2 \leq X_1 \mid X_1 > x, X_2 > x)$: probability that an active $x$-year-old employee will die as active during the next year.
- $p_x^a = 1 - i_x - q_x^{aa}$: probability that a $x$-year-old active person will survive next year as active.
- $l_x^a = \mathbb{P}(X_1 > x, X_2 > x)$: probability that an employee is still active (neither disabled nor dead) at age $x$.
- $q_x^a = \mathbb{P}(X_2 \leq x+1 \mid X_1 > x, X_2 > x)$: probability that a $x$-year-old active employee will die during the next year (regardless of active or disabled status).
- $q_x^g = \mathbb{P}(X_2 \leq x+1 \mid X_2 > x)$: general probability that a $x$-year-old person will die in the next year.
- $p_x^g = \mathbb{P}(X_2 > x+1 \mid X_2 > x)$: general probability that a $x$-year-old person will survive the next year.
- $l_x^g = \mathbb{P}(X_2 > x)$: non-conditional probability of surviving to age $x$.

## Additional Examples and Remarks

- Example: To calculate the probability that a $55$-year-old employee survives the next $4$ years:
  - $4p_{55} = p_{55} \cdot p_{56} \cdot p_{57} \cdot p_{58}$
  - Each $p_{x}$ can be replaced by $1 - q_x$ (using one-year leaving probabilities).
- Example: For half-year probabilities:
  - Given $p_x = {}_{1/2}p_x \cdot {}_{1/2}p_{x+1/2}$, it follows that ${}_{1/2}p_{x+1/2} = \frac{p_x}{{}_{1/2}p_x} = \frac{1-q_x}{1- \frac{1}{2} q_x}$
  - Similarly, ${}_{1/2}q_{x+1/2} = \frac{1}{2} q_x / (1 - \frac{1}{2} q_x)$
