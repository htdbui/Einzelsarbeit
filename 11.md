# Hierarchical Structured Notes: Life Insurance Mathematics (Lecture Unit 11)

---

## 1. Introduction

- The lecture is part of an 11-unit course on life insurance mathematics.
- Focus: Calculation and theory of partial value (`_mV_x` or `mVx`).
- The session includes:
  - Definition and special cases of partial value.
  - A remark (rule of thumb) useful for exercises and exams.
  - A detailed example with three subcases.
  - Theoretical foundations: balance equation, Thiele’s equation, Cantelli’s theorem.
  - Historical/psychological context and terminology.

## 2. Definition of Partial Value (`_mV_x`)

### 2.1 Formal Definition

- Partial value, notation: `_mV_x` where `m ∈ ℕ`, `x` is the entry age.
- Defined as:
  - If balance-age `x+m` is **before** changing to another employer:
    - `_mV_x := A_{x+m} = 𝔓_x ⋅ \ddot{a}_{x+m:n-m}^a`
  - If balance-age `x+m` is **after** changing to another company:
    - `_mV_x := A_{x+m}`

- Additional expressions:
  - `R_x = \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_{x:m}}`
  - `𝔓_x = \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_{x:m}}`

- In lecture notation:
  - The partial value `MBX` is defined as:
    - `MBX = A_{X+M} + MUS ⋅ B_X ⋅ A_{X+M}^{N-M}`
    - Details:
      - `A_{X+M}`: Present value of all expected future payouts for an `(X + M)`-year-old.
      - Annuitant payouts: retirement annuity, disability annuity.
      - `B_X`: Yearly constant artificial premium (not paid from annual age X until retirement).
      - `n`: Number of years from age X to retirement age Z.
      - `n - m`: Maximum number of years paying the premium.
      - Yearly person premium can be replaced using the equivalence principle.

### 2.2 Equivalence Principle

- The present value of future expected premium income = present value of future expected payout.
- At entry age X, both must be equal.
- The difference is the partial value.

## 3. Special Case and Correction

- If the final age `x+m` is after changing to another employer, partial value is just `A_{x+m}`.
- If before, use the formula with the premium and annuity terms.
- This correction addresses a previously omitted second situation.

## 4. Remark: Rule of Thumb for Partial Value Calculation

- Useful for the third exercise sheet and for the exam.
- Approximation formula:
  - `${}_{m+1}V_x \approx {}_{m}V_x ⋅ 1.03 ⋅ \frac{m+1}{m}$
- Assumptions:
  - No change in yearly salary between ages `x+m` and `x+m+1`.
  - No disability, retirement, or death occurs between these ages.
- Application:
  - Used for probability checks and validation of pension reserve calculations one year later when no change in the employee’s general situation.

## 5. Calculation Examples for `_mV_x`

### 5.1 Pension Scheme Promised by the Company

- **Retirement Annuity**: Monthly (in advance), 1% of yearly salary per full employed year, max 25%.
- **Disability Annuity**: Monthly (in advance), lifelong, 80% of entitled retirement annuity.
- **Widow Annuity**:
  - 60% of entitled retirement annuity if dying as active or retired.
  - 60% of disability annuity if dying as disabled.

### 5.2 Example Calculations

#### a) Employee A

- Changes company in 2004 at age 52 after 26 full employed years.
- Yearly salary: €30,000 in 2004.
- Balance date: after change, so use the “after” case.
- Entry age: 26; current age: 52; M = 26.
- Maximum years at first company: 39 (since 26+39=65 retirement).
- Calculation:
  - ${}_{26}V_{52} = 30,000 × 0.25 × (\frac{D_{65}}{D_{52}})^{(12)}\ddot{a}_{65}^{ai} + 0.8 × \ddot{a}_{52}^{ai} + 0.6 × \ddot{a}_{52}^{aaw} + 0.8 × \ddot{a}_{52}^{aiw}$
- Retirement annuity is capped at 25% (not 30% if more than 25 years).
- Discount from age 65 to 52 for the retirement annuity using present value factors.
- Disability annuity: 80% of the retirement annuity, lifelong.
- Widow annuity: 60% of retirement (if dying as active) or 60% of disability (if dying as disabled).
- All annuities are based on the yearly salary.

#### b) Employee B

- Changes company in 2002 at age 47 after 18 full employed years; gets disabled in 2004.
- Yearly salary: €24,000.
- Entry age: 29; current age in 2004: 49 (2 years after change).
- Maximum possible years: 36 (29+36=65).
- Calculation:
  - ${}_{20}V_{49} = A_{49} = (\frac{18}{36} × 24,000 × 0.8 × 0.2 (^{(12)}\ddot{a}_{49}^{i} + 0.6^{(12)}\ddot{a}_{49}^{i2}))$
- Disability annuity: calculated for 18 years at the first employer (take into account for the present value factor).
- For the widow annuity, use the appropriate present value factors.
- Annuitant payouts start immediately since the employee is now disabled.
- No discounting needed since payout starts at current age.

#### c) Employee C

- Changes company in 2004 at age 39 after 13 full employed years.
- Yearly salary: €25,000.
- Entry age: 26; M = 13; current age: 39.
- Maximum possible years: 39 (26+39=65).
- Calculation:
  - Task: calculate ${}_{13}V_{39} = A_{39}$
- Retirement annuity: capped at 25% after 25 years; for years before 25, increases by 1% per year.
- Disability annuity: complex, must account for increase in entitlement each year until the cap is reached.
- Widow annuity:
  - If dying as active: 60% of retirement annuity, increases by 1% per additional year, capped at 25%.
  - If dying as disabled: 60% of disability annuity, same increment structure, capped.

## 6. Theoretical Foundations

### 6.1 Balance Equation (Pension Reserves)

- Expressed as:
  - ${}_mV_x + {}_mP_x = {}_mL_x + V \cdot (1 - \sum_{i=1}^{k}q_{x+m}^{(i)}) \cdot {}_{m+1}V_x$
- Terms:
  - `${}_mV_x`: Partial value at age X after m years.
  - `${}_mP_x`: Artificial premium at age X + m.
  - `${}_mL_x`: Annuity payout at age X + m.
  - `V`: Discount factor.
  - `q_{x+m}^{(i)}`: Probability of leaving reason i at age X + m.

- Interpretation:
  - At each balance date, pension reserves and premium income must match payouts and future reserves (discounted by survival probability).

### 6.2 Thiele’s Equation (Discrete Case)

- Expressed as:
  - `${}_{m+1}V_x - {}_{m}V_x = i \cdot {}_{m}V_x + (1+i) \cdot ({}_{m}P_x - {}_{m}L_x) + \sum_{i=1}^{k} q_{x+m}^{(i)} \cdot {}_{m+1}V_x`
- Terms:
  - `i`: Interest rate.
  - The summation represents the inherited portion (if employees die/leave, their reserves are inherited by others).
- For continuous ages, Thiele’s equation is a derivative equation.

#### Proof Outline

- Multiply both sides of the balance equation by $(1+i)$:
  - $(1+i) \cdot {}_mV_x + (1+i)({}_mP_x - {}_mL_x) = (1+i) V (1 - \sum_{i=1}^k q_{x+m}^{(i)}) {}_{m+1}V_x$
- Rearranged, gives the discrete Thiele’s equation.

#### Inherited Portion

- Summation term: $\sum_{i=1}^{k} q_{x+m}^{(i)} \cdot {}_{m+1}V_x$
- Represents reserves inherited by remaining employees if someone leaves (due to death, disability, etc.).

## 7. Theorem of Cantelli

- Statement:
  - The mathematical calculations of all present values (such as $P_x$ of $_mV_x$) are independent of the way the annuity payout is structured: as capital lump sum or as an annuity.
- Context:
  - 25–30 years ago, employees of large companies (>1,000 employees) could choose between:
    - Lump sum payout (capital) at retirement.
    - Lifelong annuity.
  - Mathematical equivalence proved by Cantelli.
  - Lump sum: payout equals the partial value $_mV_x$ at retirement.
- Psychological aspect (“anti-selection”):
  - Healthy employees choose annuities (expecting to live longer).
  - Employees with health problems choose lump sum (expecting shorter life).
  - This selection behavior (“anti-selection”) produces financial disadvantages for companies:
    - Companies pay more to healthy annuitants than predicted by expected present value calculations.
    - Lump sum payouts to unhealthy employees match expected value, but overall result is a loss for the company.
  - Therefore, nowadays, large companies generally do not offer this choice anymore.

## 8. Premium Determination: Saving and Risk Premium

- From the balance equation:
  - Divide by $(1+i)$ to get:
    - $v \cdot {}_{m+1}V_x - {}_{m}V_x + {}_{m}L_x - v \cdot \sum_{i=1}^k q_{x+m}^{(i)} \cdot {}_{m+1}V_x$
  - $v = 1/(1+i)$ is the discount factor.
- Interpretation:
  - The first part: Saving premium (can be invested).
  - The second part: Risk premium (at risk, due to payouts and inherited reserves).
  - Minus sign: The reserves of employees who leave are overtaken by the remaining employees.
