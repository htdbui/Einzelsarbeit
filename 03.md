## 2. Recap: Basic Definitions and Probabilities

### 2.1. Model and Random Variables
- Two random leaving reasons:
  - Death and Disability.
  - Random variables:
    - $X_1$: Age at occurrence of disability.
    - $X_2$: Age at occurrence of death.

### 2.2. One-Year Disability Probability ($i_x$)
- Definition: Probability that an $x$-year-old active employee will get disabled during next year.
- Mathematical definition via conditional probability:
  - Start situation: Employee at age $x$ is neither disabled nor dead (active).
    - $X_1 > x$, $X_2 > x$.
  - Probability to get disabled during next year:
    - $X_1 \leq x+1$.
    - To get disabled during next year means to survive: $X_1 \leq X_2$.

### 2.3. One-Year Death Probability as Active ($q_x^a$)
- Definition: Probability that an $x$-year-old active employee will die during next year as active.
- Start: $X_1 > x$, $X_2 > x$.
- Probability to die during next year: $X_2 \leq x+1$, dying as active ($X_2 \leq X_1$).

### 2.4. Probability to Survive as Active ($p_x^a$)
- Defined as: $p_x^a = 1 - i_x - q_x^a$.
- Interpretation: Probability that an $x$-year-old active person will survive next year as active.
- Neither becoming disabled during next year nor dying as active.

### 2.5. Population Counts
- $l_x^a$: Number/probability of active $x$-year-olds (neither disabled nor dead).
  - $X_1 > x$, $X_2 > x$.
- $l_x^g$: Probability of being alive at age $x$ (active or disabled).

### 2.6. General Death Probability ($q_x^g$)
- Defined as: Probability that an $x$-year-old person will die during next year (regardless of disability status).
- Includes both cases: dying as active or dying as disabled.

### 2.7. Death Probability for Disabled ($q_x^i$)
- Probability that an $x$-year-old disabled person will die during next year.
- Condition: $X_1 \leq x$ (already disabled at age $x$), $X_2 \leq x+1$ (dies during next year).

### 2.8. Exercise References
- Special symbols $l_x^g$, $p_x^g$, etc., may appear in exercises; not required for the exam unless specifically discussed.

## 3. Pension Axioms (Lecture Note Section 2.4)

### 3.1. Axiom 1: Uniform Distribution of Leaving Times
- Leaving time points (for death, disability, contract canceling) are uniformly distributed over the year.
- Implication: $E(X_1 - \lfloor X_1 \rfloor) = E(X_2 - \lfloor X_2 \rfloor) = \frac{1}{2}$.
- The differences $(X_1 - \lfloor X_1 \rfloor)$ and $(X_2 - \lfloor X_2 \rfloor)$ follow the uniform distribution $U(0,1)$.

### 3.2. Implication for Probabilities
- For all $u \in [0,1]$, ${}_u q_x = u \cdot q_x$ (and analogously for $q_x^b$ for $b \in \{i, a, aa, g\}$).

### 3.3. Axioms 2 and 3
- Will be defined later.

## 4. First Consistency Equation of RT 2005G (Lecture Note Section 2.5)

### 4.1. Theorem (Consistency Equation)
- For all ages $x < z$ (retirement age):
  - $q_x^g = \frac{l_x^a}{l_x^g} q_x^a + \frac{l_x^i}{l_x^g} q_x^i$
  - $l_x^i = l_x^g - l_x^a$

### 4.2. Interpretation
- $q_x^g$ is a weighted average of $q_x^a$ (active) and $q_x^i$ (disabled).

### 4.3. Corollary
- For all $u \in [0,1]$, ${}_u q^g_x = u \cdot q^g_x$

### 4.4. Proof Outline
- $q_x^g = \mathbb{P}(X_2 \leq x+1 | X_2 > x)$
- Express as sum of conditional probabilities:
  - $\mathbb{P}(X_2 \leq x+1; X_1 \leq x | X_2 > x)$
  - $\mathbb{P}(X_2 \leq x+1; X_1 > x | X_2 > x)$
- Show how each term reduces to $q_x^a \frac{l_x^a}{l_x^g}$ and $q_x^i \frac{l_x^i}{l_x^g}$.

## 5. Splitting and Composition of Probabilities

### 5.1. Splitting Death Probability
- $q_x^a = q_x^{aa} + i_x \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}q^i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$
  - $q_x^{aa}$: Probability of dying as active.
  - $q_x^{ai}$: Probability of becoming disabled and then dying as disabled during next year.

### 5.2. Intermediate Probabilities
- $q_x^{ai} = i_x \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}q^i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$
  - Probability that an $x$-year-old active employee becomes disabled and then dies as disabled during next year.
- ${}_{\frac{1}{2}}q^i_{x+\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} q^i_x}{1 - \frac{1}{2} q^i_x}$

### 5.3. Total Death Probability
- $q_x = q_x^a + q_x^i$

### 6.2. Widow Mortality

  - ${}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$: Probability that a disabled person of age $x+\frac{1}{2}$ survives the rest of the year.

#### 6.4.2. Active Survivorship
- $p^a_x$: Probability that an $x$-year-old active person will survive next year as active.

- $p^a_x = 1 - q^a_x = p^{ai}_x + p^a_x$: Probability that an $x$-year-old active person will survive next year as either active or disabled.

#### 6.4.3. Widow Transition Probabilities ($p^{bw}_x$)
- $b \in \{r, g, i\}$ (retired, general, disabled)
- $p^{bw}_x = q^b_x \cdot h_x \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^w_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}$
  - $q^b_x$: Probability of death for status $b$.
  - $h_x$: Probability of being married at time of death.
  - ${}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^w_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}$: Probability that the widow (of expected age $y(x)+\frac{1}{2}$) survives the rest of the year.

#### 6.4.4. Widow Transition Probabilities (Death)
- $q^{rw}_x, q^{iw}_x$: Probability that an $x$-year-old disabled/retired person will die during next year, will be married at the time of death, and the widow will die during next year.

#### 6.4.5. Active-to-Death as Active and Widow Survives ($p_x^{aaw}$)
- Probability that an $x$-year-old active employee will die as active during next year, will be married at time of death, and widow will survive rest of year:
  - $p_x^{aaw} = q_x^{aa} \cdot h_x \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^w_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}$
- Analogously defined: $q_x^{aaw}$

#### 6.4.6. Active-to-Disability-to-Death and Widow Survives ($p_x^{aiw}$)
- Probability that $x$-year-old active employee will become disabled during next year, will die during rest of the year, will be married at time point of death, and widow survives rest of year:
  - $p_x^{aiw} = i_x \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}q^i_{x+\frac{1}{2}} \cdot h_x \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^w_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}$

#### 6.4.7. Active-to-Disability-to-Death and Widow Dies ($q_x^{aiw}$)

## 7. Further Symbol Definitions and Interpretations

### 7.1. Additional Transition Probabilities
- $p_x^{aaw}$: Probability that an $x$-year-old active employee will die as active during next year, will be married at time of death, and widow will survive rest of year.
- $p_x^{aiw}$: Probability that $x$-year-old active employee will become disabled during next year, will die during rest of year, will be married, and widow survives.
- $q_x^{aiw}$: Probability that $x$-year-old active employee will become disabled during next year, will die during rest of year, will be married, and widow also dies.

### 7.2. Factorization of Probabilities
- Probabilities with two transitions (e.g., $ai$) can often be expressed as products:
  - Example: $p^{ai}_x = i_x \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$
- Probabilities with three transitions (e.g., $aiw$) require four factors:
  - Example: $p_x^{aiw} = i_x \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}q^i_{x+\frac{1}{2}} \cdot h_x \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^w_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}$

## 8. Application to Exercises

### 8.1. Exercise 1
- Multi-year surviving probabilities can be replaced by one-year probabilities:
  - $n q_x = 1 - n p_x$
  - $n p_x$ can be expressed with $1 - q_{x+j-1}$ for $j = 1, ..., n$
- Suggested proof by induction.

### 8.2. Exercise 2
- Define random variables $X_1$ (disability age) and $X_2$ (death age).
- Express transition probabilities ($p_x^{ai}$) using $X_1$ and $X_2$ as conditional probabilities.
- Prove three equations by replacing transition probabilities with mathematical definitions via $X_1$ and $X_2$.

### 8.3. Exercise 3
- Introduce random variable $Y$ (age of widow at time of death of spouse).
- Express transition probabilities ($p_x^{iw}$, $p_x^{gw}$, $p_x^{aw}$, $p_x^{aiw}$, etc.) using $X_1$, $X_2$, $Y$.
- Prove second consistency equation: $p_x^{gw} = \frac{l_x^a}{l_x^g} p_x^{aw} + \frac{l_x^i}{l_x^g} p_x^{iw}$, with $l_x^i = l_x^g - l_x^a$.

### 8.4. Exercise 4
- Closed-form formulas for probabilities that a 52-year-old active person reaches age 55 as disabled, etc.
- Consider all possible paths and express each as a product of the relevant probabilities.

- Many leaving probabilities can be split into disjoint cases (e.g., dying as active or as disabled).
- Half-year probabilities can be expressed by one-year probabilities.

### 9.2. Symbol Definitions
- Defined many new symbols for transition probabilities, marriage probabilities, widowhood, etc.
