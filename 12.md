# Pension Insurance Mathematics: Chapter I – Hierarchical Structured Notes

---

## 1. Completion of Chapter and Scope
- The 12-lecture unit concludes the First Chapter of Pension Insurance Mathematics.
- Discussion of the third exercise sheet remains but, from the topic and starting point of view, the insurance mathematics chapter will be finished in this course.

---

## 2. Third Calculation Example: Partial Value Calculation

### 2.1. Situation Overview
- An employee:
  - Joined the company in 1990.
  - Has actuarial age of 47 at 31.12.2002.

### 2.2. Pension Scheme Promised by Company
- Annuities in case of:
  - Disability before retirement age (62).
  - Retirement at age 62.
  - No widow annuity.

#### 2.2.1. Monthly Disability Annuity Table

| Age | Monthly Annuity (€) |
|-----|---------------------|
| Until 42 | 0 |
| 43 | 1200 |
| 44 | 1250 |
| 45 | 1300 |
| 46 | 1350 |
| 47 | 1400 |
| 48 | 1450 |
| 49 | 1500 |
| 50 | 1600 |
| 51 | 1700 |
| 52 | 1800 |
| 53 | 1900 |
| 54 | 2000 |
| 55 | 2000 |
| 56 | 2000 |
| 57 | 2000 |
| 58 | 2000 |
| 59 | 2000 |
| 60 | 2000 |
| 61 | 2000 |
| 62 | 1640 |

#### 2.2.2. Explanation of Table
- If the employee is disabled until age 42: monthly annuity = €0.
- At age 43: €1,200; increases by €50 each year until 49.
- At age 50: jump to €1,600, then €100 increases per year until 54.
- From ages 54 to 61: €2,000 per month.
- At retirement at 62: €1,640 per month.

### 2.3. Calculation of Partial Value at 31.12.2002

#### 2.3.1. Determination of Key Ages
- \( x + m = 47 \) (actual age at 31.12.2002)
- Entry age \( x = 47 - 13 = 34 \)
- \( m = 2003 - 1990 = 13 \) (since 1.1.2003 is closer to 31.12.2002 than 1.1.2002)
- Retirement age \( z = 62 \)
- Maximum possible years for premium payment: \( z - x = 62 - 34 = 28 \)

#### 2.3.2. Partial Value Formula
- \( _{13}V_{34} = A_{47} - \frac{A_{34}}{\ddot{a}^a_{34:28}} \cdot \ddot{a}^a_{47:15} \)
  - \( A_{34} = P_{34} \cdot \ddot{a}_{34:28} \)
  - Where \( P_{34} \) is the artificial yearly premium

#### 2.3.3. Calculation of \( A_{34} \) (Present Value at Entry Age)
- \( A_{34} = 12 \cdot (1200 \cdot ^{(12)}\ddot{a}_{43}^{aiA} \cdot \frac{D_{43}^a}{D_{34}^a} \)
  - \( + 50 \cdot ^{(12)}\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_{44}^{aiA} \cdot \frac{D_{44}^a}{D_{34}^a} \)
  - \( + 50 \cdot ^{(12)}\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_{50}^{aiA} \cdot \frac{D_{50}^a}{D_{34}^a} \)
  - \( - 100 \cdot ^{(12)}\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_{55}^{aiA} \cdot \frac{D_{55}^a}{D_{34}^a} \)
  - \( - 360 \cdot ^{(12)}\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_{62}^{aiA} \cdot \frac{D_{62}^a}{D_{34}^a}) \)
    - Each term reflects the increments and decrements in annuity at certain ages per the table.

#### 2.3.4. Calculation of \( A_{47} \) (Present Value at Current Age)
- \( A_{47} = 12 \cdot (1400 \cdot ^{(12)}\ddot{a}_{47}^{aiA} \)
  - \( + 50 \cdot ^{(12)}\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_{48}^{aiA} \cdot \frac{D_{48}^a}{D_{47}^a} \)
  - \( + 50 \cdot ^{(12)}\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_{50}^{aiA} \cdot \frac{D_{50}^a}{D_{47}^a} \)
  - \( - 100 \cdot ^{(12)}\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_{55}^{aiA} \cdot \frac{D_{55}^a}{D_{47}^a} \)
  - \( - 360 \cdot ^{(12)}\overset{\angle}{\ddot{a}}_{62}^{aiA} \cdot \frac{D_{62}^a}{D_{47}^a} ) \)

#### 2.3.5. Notes on Calculation Process
- All present value factors are in respect of yearly aggregate (12 times the monthly annuity).
- The increasing and stepwise increments in annuity are handled via the specified symbols and increments/decrements in the formula.
- The increasing process for annuity stops at age 55; from 55–61 payout is constant.
- At age 62, the retirement annuity drops to €1,640 per month.

#### 2.3.6. Application of the Principle of Equivalence
- The expected present value of all future expected annuity payouts at entry year is equal to the expected future premium (not the constant premium tax).
- The quotient \( \frac{A_{34}}{\ddot{a}^a_{34:28}} \) is the artificial premium per the principle of equivalence.

#### 2.3.7. Interpretation of Annuity Payments
- If an employee is disabled at a given age, the corresponding annuity is paid until death (not increasing annually, fixed at the age of disability).
- If an employee reaches retirement age as active, receives €1,640 monthly until death.

## 3. The Modified Partial Value

### 3.1. Disadvantage of the Current Partial Value Definition
- The definition of the partial value in §6a of the German Income Tax Law uses a yearly constant premium via the principle of equivalence.
- Disadvantage: the premium \( P_x \) is defined \( m \) years before the balance age \( x + m \).
  - At age \( x+m \), more detailed information is available and should be incorporated.

### 3.2. Proposed Modifications by Heubeck & Neuberger

#### 3.2.1. Change 1: Present Value Factor
- Instead of \( A_x \), use \( v^m \cdot A_{x+m} \)
  - \( A_x^{mod} := v^m \cdot A_{x+m} \)
  - Rationale: reflects most current information at balance age, discounted back to entry age.

#### 3.2.2. Change 2: Present Value of Annuity
- Instead of \( \ddot{a}^a_{x:n} \), use:
  - \( \ddot{a}_{m\rceil} + v^m \cdot \ddot{a}^a_{x+m:n-m} \)
    - Where \( \ddot{a}_{m\rceil} = \sum_{k=0}^{m-1}{v^k} \) (no probabilities, just discounting)
    - \( \ddot{a}^a_{x+m:n-m} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-m-1}{v^k \cdot {}_{h}p_{x+m}} \) (probabilities for future payouts)
  - Rationale: for years up to \( x+m \), discount only (employee is alive); for years after, include survival probabilities.

#### 3.2.3. Modified Partial Value Formula
- \( _mV_x^{mod} = A_{x+m} - \left( \frac{v^m \cdot A_{x+m}}{\ddot{a}_{m\rceil} + v^m \cdot \ddot{a}^a_{x+m:n-m}} \right) \cdot \ddot{a}^a_{x+m:n-m} \)

- Or, simplified:
  - \( _mV_x^{mod} = \frac{A_{x+m} \cdot \ddot{a}_{m\rceil}}{\ddot{a}_{m\rceil} + v^m \cdot \ddot{a}^a_{x+m:n-m}} \)

#### 3.2.4. Advantages
- Takes into account all information available at age \( x+m \).
- Both numerator and denominator are in line with present values at entry age.
- Simplifies calculation for students (only compute \( A_{x+m} \)).

## 4. Summary of Chapter I: Pension Insurance Mathematics

### 4.1. Key Points

#### 4.1.1. Pension Promises
- Employers promise employees:
  - Retirement annuities
  - Disability annuities
  - Widow annuities (not in this specific example)

#### 4.1.2. Pension Reserves Calculation
- Companies must calculate pension reserves (\( _mV_x \)) for balance sheets.
- Reserves equivalent to loss reserves in insurance companies.

#### 4.1.3. Assumptions and Mechanics
- Employees treated as insured, paying an artificial yearly premium (\( P_x \)) to employer (insurer) between entry age \( x \) and retirement age \( z \).
- Premiums and reserves calculated actuarially at present values (basis: entry age and balance age).

#### 4.1.4. Tax and Financing
- Company saves profit tax (approx. 30%) by setting pension reserves in balance sheet.
- Pension reserves finance employee annuities.

#### 4.1.5. Technical Foundations
- Present value calculations based on:
  - Entry age \( x \), balance age \( x+m \)
  - Interest rate \( i = 3.25\% \) per annum (minimum, as per §6a German Law)
    - Ensures fairness and prevents moral hazard
  - Heubeck notation and mortality table 2005 G
  - Calculation rules and notation defined in §6a

#### 4.1.6. Additional Notes
- If modified partial value replaces old definition, only one basis is used.
- Section §6a defines all calculation rules, interest rate, and present value factors.

### 4.2. Structure of the Lecture Series
- 28 lecture units in total:
  - 13 on pension insurance mathematics (main part of life insurance)
  - 8 on health insurance
  - 7 on factory area/life insurance

---

## 5. Final Remarks
- Next lecture will cover the third exercise sheet, including another partial value calculation.
- Chapter II (Health Insurance Mathematics) to begin in lecture unit 14.
- All technical terms, formulae, definitions, and stepwise explanations are preserved and structured as detailed above.
