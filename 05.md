## 2.6. Transition Probabilities

### Overview

- Transition probabilities include both leaving and surviving probabilities.
- Previous lecture discussed 11 transition probabilities; definition 12 is introduced here.

---

### Definition 12: Transition Probability $p_x^{aw}$

- For all $x \in \mathbb{N}_{<z}$ (i.e., for all natural numbers $x$ less than retirement age $z$):
    - $p_x^{aw}$: Probability that an $x$-year-old active employee will:
        - Die during the next year,
        - Be married at the time-point of death,
        - The widow will survive the rest of the year.
    - $p_x^{aw} = p_x^{aaw} + p_x^{aiw}$
        - $p_x^{aaw}$: Probability that the employee will die as active.
        - $p_x^{aiw}$: Probability that the employee will die as disabled.
    - $p_x^{aiw} = q_x^{ai} \cdot h_x \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^{w}_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}}$
        - $q_x^{ai} = i_x \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}q^{i}_{x+\frac{1}{2}}}$
        - $h_x$: Probability that the employee will be married at time-point of death.
        - ${{}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^{w}_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{1-q_{y(x)}^{w}}{1-\frac{1}{2}q_{y(x)}^{w}}$
            - $y(x) + \frac{1}{2}$: The widow's age at the expected time point (middle of the year).
    - $q_x^{ai}$: Expressed as $i_x \cdot {_\frac{1}{2}}q_x^i$
    - Each of $p_x^{aaw}$ and $p_x^{aiw}$ can be expressed via mortality tables and marriage probability tables.

#### Required Tables

- Mortality tables:
    - For disabled persons,
    - For widows,
    - For general population.
- One-year disability table ($i_x$).
- Marriage probability table ($h_x$).

#### Generalization

- Each transition probability can be expressed by listed mortalities $q_x^b$ ($b \in \{i, w, r\}$), listed disability $i_x$, and listed marriage probability $h_x$.

### Theorems

#### First Theorem

- $_up_{x}^{()} = u q_x^{()}$ for all $u \in [0,1]$ and all situations.
    - This is the probability that an $x$-year-old person will leave in the next time span $u$.
    - $u$ is real, $0 \leq u \leq 1$.

#### Second Theorem: Uniform Theorem of Pension Insurance Mathematics (Proved by Neuberger)

- General version:
    - Let $X, Y$ be two random variables on $(\Omega, \sigma, \mathbb{P})$:
        - $X, Y: \Omega \rightarrow \{1, ..., n\}$ (discrete, $n \in \mathbb{N}$)
        - Or $X, Y: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ (continuous)
    - Both $X$ and $Y$ have the same distribution.
    - If $X \leq Y$ almost surely (a.s.), i.e., $X(\omega) \leq Y(\omega)$ for all $\omega \in \Omega$,
        - Then $X = Y$ almost surely ($\mathbb{P}(X = Y) = 1$).

##### Corollary

- If an active employee gets disabled and dies in the same year, then:
    - The expected period between getting disabled and death is zero almost surely.
    - The expected time-point of getting disabled equals the expected time-point of death, if both occur in the same year.
        - $\mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{1}{2} = \mathbb{E}(Y)$
        - Expected time-point is at age $x + \frac{1}{2}$ or $y(x) + \frac{1}{2}$.

##### Proof (Discrete Case)

- Let $X, Y$ be random variables with same distribution, $X \leq Y$ a.s., $X, Y: \Omega \rightarrow \{1, ..., n\}$.
- Define $p_k = \mathbb{P}(Y = k) = \mathbb{P}(X = k)$ for $k \in \{1, ..., n\}$.
1. Because $X \leq Y$ a.s., $\mathbb{P}(X = j; Y = k) = 0$ for $j > k$.
    - $\mathbb{P}(X > Y) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(X \leq Y) = 0$.
2. $\mathbb{P}(X = 1; Y = 1) = \mathbb{P}(X = 1) = \mathbb{P}(Y = 1) = p_1$.
    - $p_1 = \mathbb{P}(Y = 1) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \mathbb{P}(Y = 1; X = j) = \mathbb{P}(Y = 1; X = 1)$.
3. $\mathbb{P}(X = 1; Y = k) = 0$ for all $k \in \{2, ..., n\}$.
    - $\mathbb{P}(X = 1) = \mathbb{P}(X = 1; Y = 1) + \sum_{k=2}^{n} \mathbb{P}(X = 1; Y = k)$.
    - All terms in the sum must be zero.
4. Analogously, for all $j, k$ with $k > j$, $\mathbb{P}(X = j; Y = k) = 0$.
    - For all $k$, $\mathbb{P}(X = k; Y = k) = \mathbb{P}(X = k) = \mathbb{P}(Y = k) = p_k$.
    - $\mathbb{P}(X > Y) = 0 \implies \mathbb{P}(X = Y) = \mathbb{P}(X \leq Y) - \mathbb{P}(X < Y) = 1 - 0 = 1$.

##### Proof (Continuous Case)

- $X, Y$ be continuous random variables with same distributions, $X \leq Y$ a.s.
- For any $t \in \mathbb{R}$:
    - $\mathbb{P}(X \leq t) = \mathbb{P}(X \leq t, X \leq Y) = \mathbb{P}(X \leq Y \leq t) + \mathbb{P}(X \leq t < Y)$.
    - $\mathbb{P}(X \leq t) = \mathbb{P}(Y \leq t) + \mathbb{P}(X \leq t < Y)$.
    - Since $X, Y$ have same distribution, $\mathbb{P}(X \leq t) = \mathbb{P}(Y \leq t)$.
    - Thus, $\mathbb{P}(X \leq t < Y) = 0$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$.
    - $\mathbb{P}(X < Y) = 0$, so $\mathbb{P}(X = Y) = 1$.

###### Further Details on Proof

- $\mathbb{P}(X < Y) = \mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} \{X \leq q < Y\}\right) \leq \sum_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} \mathbb{P}(X \leq q < Y)$, since $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.
- All terms in the sum are zero, leading to $\mathbb{P}(X < Y) = 0$.

## 2.7. The Enhanced Leaving Order

### Overview

- Previously, two random leaving reasons considered: disability and death.
- Now, a third is added: fluctuation (changing employer).
    - Reaching retirement age is deterministic, not random, and not considered a random leaving reason.

### Random Leaving Reasons

- Fluctuation (switch to another company)
- Disability
- Death

#### Importance of Fluctuation

- In Germany, after 5 years at a company, employees who change jobs are entitled to pro rata annuities from the original employer.
- Companies with pension promises must consider fluctuation seriously.

#### Assumptions

- Time points of all three occurrences are uniformly distributed over the year; i.e., for $i = 1, 2, 3$, $X_i - \lfloor X_i \rfloor \sim U(0,1)$.
    - $X_1$: Age at fluctuation
    - $X_2$: Age at disability
    - $X_3$: Age at death

#### Populations

- Internal employees: Those still working at a company (main population).
- External employees: Those who worked more than five years, then changed company.
    - Old company must still provide benefits (e.g., disability annuities) if disability occurs.

### Symbols and Definitions (Heubach Notation)

#### $s_x$ (Switching Probability)

- For all $x \in \mathbb{N}_{<z}$,
    - $s_x$: Probability that an $x$-year-old active employee will switch to another company during next year ($[x, x+1)$).
    - $s_x := \mathbb{P}(X_1 \leq \min\{x + 1, X_2, X_3\} \mid X_1 > x, X_2 > x, X_3 > x)$

#### "Hat" Notation: Refers to Internal Employees

- $\hat{i}_x := \mathbb{P}(X_2 \leq x + 1; X_2 \leq X_1; X_2 \leq X_3 | X_i > x, i = 1,2,3)$
    - Probability that an internal employee gets disabled during next year, before fluctuation or death.
- $\hat{q}^{aa}_x := \mathbb{P}(X_3 \leq \min\{x + 1, X_1, X_2\} | X_i > x, i = 1,2,3)$
    - Probability that an internal employee dies as active during next year, before switching or disability.

#### Transition Probabilities for Internal Employees

- $\hat{p}^{as}_x$: Probability that $x$-year-old internal active employee will switch to another company during next year and survive as active external person until end of next year.
    - $\hat{p}^{as}_x = s_x \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^a_{x+\frac{1}{2}}}$
        - $s_x$: Probability of switching during next year.
        - ${{}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^a_{x+\frac{1}{2}}}$: Probability of surviving as active for 6 months after switching (expected age at switching: $x+\frac{1}{2}$).
- $\hat{q}^{as}_x = s_x \cdot \frac{1}{2}q^a_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$
    - Probability of switching and dying as active at the new company during next year.
- $\hat{p}^{ai}_x = \hat{i}_x \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^a_{x+\frac{1}{2}}}$
    - Probability that an employee stays at the same company, gets disabled during next year, and survives the rest of the year.
- $\hat{q}^{ai}_x = \hat{i}_x \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}q^i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}}$
    - Probability that an employee stays at the same company, gets disabled during next year, and dies as disabled during the rest of the year.
- $\hat{p}^{asi}_x = s_x \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}} \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}}$
    - Probability that an employee switches to another company, becomes disabled at the new company, and survives the rest of the year.
- $\hat{q}^{asi}_x = s_x \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}} \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}q^i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}}$
    - Probability that an employee switches to another company, becomes disabled at the new company, and dies as disabled during the rest of the year.

#### General Death Probability for Internal Employees

- $\hat{q}^a_x = \hat{q}^{as}_x + \hat{q}^{aa}_x + \hat{q}^{asi}_x + \hat{q}^{ai}_x$
    - Probability that an active $x$-year-old employee will die during next year, via all possible routes:
        - Switches to another company before death
        - Dies as active in old company
        - Switches to another company, gets disabled, then dies
        - Gets disabled in old company, then dies

#### Death and Widow Survival Probabilities

- $\hat{p}^{aaw}_x = \hat{q}^{aa}_x \cdot h_x \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^w_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}}$
    - Probability that an internal employee dies as active at the old company, is married at death, and widow survives the rest of the year.
- $\hat{p}^{asw}_x = \hat{q}^{as}_x \cdot h_x \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^w_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}}$
    - Probability that an internal employee switches to another company, dies before end of year at new company, is married at death, and widow survives.
- $\hat{p}^{aiw}_x = \hat{q}^{ai}_x \cdot h_x \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^w_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}}$
    - Probability that an internal employee gets disabled at the old company, dies before end of year, is married at death, and widow survives.
- $\hat{p}^{asiw}_x = \hat{q}^{asi}_x \cdot h_x \cdot {{}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^w_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}}$
    - Probability that an internal employee switches to another company, gets disabled at new company, dies before end of year, is married at death, and widow survives.

#### Similar Probabilities for Widow Dying at Year End

- For $\hat{q}^{aaw}_x$, $\hat{q}^{asw}_x$, $\hat{q}^{aiw}_x$, $\hat{q}^{asiw}_x$, replace ${}_{\frac{1}{2}}p^w_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}$ with ${}_{\frac{1}{2}}q^w_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}$ for the case where the widow does not survive the year.

#### Total Probability of Death with Widow Surviving

- $\hat{p}^{aw}_x = \hat{p}^{aiw}_x + \hat{p}^{asw}_x + \hat{p}^{aaw}_x + \hat{p}^{asiw}_x$
    - Probability that an internal employee dies during next year, is married at death, and widow survives the rest of the year.

#### Most Extreme Symbol: Four Transitions

- $P^{\hat{a}siw}_x$ or $Q^{\hat{a}siw}_x$:
    - Probability that an $x$-year-old internal employee switches to another company, gets disabled at new company before year-end, dies before year-end at new company, is married at death, and widow survives rest of the year (or dies).
    - These can be expressed by combining $s_x$, marriage probability $h_x$, mortality/disability probabilities at appropriate ages.

### Remarks: Connections and Decompositions

- $i_x = \hat{i}_x + s_x \cdot {_\frac{1}{2}}i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$
    - $i_x$: Probability that an $x$-year-old person becomes disabled during next year.
    - Two possibilities:
        - Becomes disabled at old company ($\hat{i}_x$)
        - Becomes disabled after switching ($s_x \cdot {_\frac{1}{2}}i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$)
- $i_x = {_\frac{1}{2}}i_x + {_\frac{1}{2}}p^a_x \cdot {_\frac{1}{2}}i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$
    - ${_\frac{1}{2}}i_x$: Probability of becoming disabled in first 6 months.
    - ${_\frac{1}{2}}p^a_x$: Probability of surviving as active in first half-year.
    - ${_\frac{1}{2}}i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$: Probability of becoming disabled in second half-year.
    - ${_\frac{1}{2}}i_x = \frac{1}{2}i_x$
    - ${_\frac{1}{2}}p^a_x = 1 - {_\frac{1}{2}}i_x - {_\frac{1}{2}}q^{aa}_x = 1 - \frac{1}{2}(i_x + q_x)$
    - ${_\frac{1}{2}}i_{x+\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{{_\frac{1}{2}}i_x}{{_\frac{1}{2}}p^a_x} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}i_x}{1-\frac{1}{2}(i_x+q_x)}$
- ${_\frac{1}{2}}q^{aa}_x$: Probability of dying as active in next 6 months.
- ${_\frac{1}{2}}p^a_x \cdot {_\frac{1}{2}}i_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$: Probability of becoming disabled after July and before December.

---

### Further Symbolic Connections

- $q^{aa}_x = \hat{q}^{aa}_x + s_x \cdot {_\frac{1}{2}}q^{aa}_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$
    - $q^{aa}_x$: Probability that an $x$-year-old person will die as active during next year.
    - $\hat{q}^{aa}_x$: Probability of dying as active at old company.
    - $s_x \cdot {_\frac{1}{2}}q^{aa}_{x+\frac{1}{2}}$: Probability of switching and dying as active at new company during second half of the year.

---

### Calculation Principles

- All complex transition probabilities (including those involving marriage and widowhood, disability, death, switching) can be expressed using:
    - One-year mortality tables,
    - One-year disability tables,
    - Probability tables of being married,
    - All for appropriate ages (whole year or half year as specified by uniform theorem).

---

## Summary

- The lecture introduced the detailed structure of transition probabilities for pension mathematics, especially in the presence of three random leaving reasons (fluctuation, disability, death).
- The uniform theorem provides a critical tool for calculating expected values and transition probabilities, especially when multiple risks may occur within the same year.
- All formulas are constructed in a way that allows their computation from known actuarial tables (mortality, disability, marriage).
- The system of notation (Heubach, Obeck) is carefully adhered to throughout.
