## 1. Invariance Theorem (Noberger’s Theorem)

### 1.1 Statement of the Theorem

- Present value factors of prospective annuities with:
  - Stable yearly aggregate amounts
  - Deterministic payout time points
  - Are independent of the payout order, **if both the trigger event and the terminating event are uniformly distributed over the year**.

---

### 1.2 Definitions and Setup

- **Number of payout time points per year**: Let $t$ be the number of payout time points per year.
- **Stable yearly annuity amount**: Denoted by $R$ (fixed euro amount).
- **Random variables**:
  - $T_1$: Models the time point of the trigger event (when annuity payout starts).
  - $T_2$: Models the time point of the terminating event (when annuity payout ends).
  - $T_1 \leq T_2$ for all $\omega$ in $\Omega$.
- **Payout at time point $\mu$**:
  - $\mu = 1, 2, \ldots, t$; $S_\mu = \frac{\mu}{t}$
  - $R_\mu = \frac{R}{t} (\mathbb{1}_{\{T_2 \geq S_\mu\}} - \mathbb{1}_{\{T_1 \geq S_\mu\}})$

- **Indicator functions**:
  - $\mathbb{1}_{\{T_1 \geq S_\mu\}}(\omega) = \begin{cases} 1 & T_1(\omega) \geq S_\mu \\ 0 & T_1(\omega) < S_\mu \end{cases}$
  - $\mathbb{1}_{\{T_2 \geq S_\mu\}}(\omega) = \begin{cases} 1 & T_2(\omega) \geq S_\mu \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

---

### 1.3 Case Analysis for $S_\mu$:

- **Case 1**: $\frac{\mu}{t} > T_2 \geq T_1$
  - $R_\mu = 0$
- **Case 2**: $T_1 \leq \frac{\mu}{t} \leq T_2$
  - $R_\mu = \frac{R}{t}$
- **Case 3**: $\frac{\mu}{t} < T_1 \leq T_2$
  - $R_\mu = 0$

---

### 1.4 Present Value of the Annuity

- **Present value random variable**:
  - $B^{(t)} = \sum_{\mu \geq 0} v(S_\mu) \cdot R_\mu$
  - $v(S_\mu) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\mu}{t} \cdot i}$ (discount factor at $S_\mu$)
- **Rewriting**:
  - $B^{(t)} = \frac{R}{t} \sum_{\mu \geq 0} v(S_\mu) \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\{T_2 \geq S_\mu\}} - \frac{R}{t} \sum_{\mu \geq 0} v(S_\mu) \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\{T_1 \geq S_\mu\}}$

---

### 1.5 Application of Main Theorem and Correction Terms

- $\mathbb{E}(B_1^{(t)}) = \mathbb{E}(B_1^{(1)}) = k(t)$
- By Neuburger's main theorem: $\ddot{a}_x = {}^{(t)}\ddot{a}_x + k(t)$
- $\mathbb{E}(B_2^{(t)}) = \mathbb{E}(B_2^{(1)}) - k(t)$
- Thus,
  - $\mathbb{E}(B_1^{(t)}) - \mathbb{E}(B_2^{(t)}) = \mathbb{E}(B_1^{(1)}) - \mathbb{E}(B_2^{(1)}) = \mathbb{E}(B^{(1)})$

---

### 1.6 Uniform Distribution Assumption

- **Necessary for the proof**: Trigger and terminating events must be uniformly distributed over the year.
- **Probability of death relationship**: $q_x = u \cdot q_{x+u},\quad u \in [0,1]$
- **Reason**: Needed to derive equations 1 and 2 and to apply the correction term theory.

---

### 1.7 Conclusion of the Proof

- Present value factors are independent of the payout order, provided both the trigger and terminating events are uniformly distributed over the year.
- This is essential for the correct calculation of pension reserves for balance sheets.

## 2. Pension Insurance Mathematics: Partial Value (Pension Reserves)

---

### 2.1 Context and Motivation

- Companies are legally required to put pension reserves into the balance sheet.
- Calculation must be mathematically correct.
- To ensure this, employees are assumed to pay an artificial premium to the employer (mirroring an insurance situation).
- The employer acts as the insurer; the employee as the insured.
- This is equivalent to an insurance scenario, particularly in reserve calculations.
- In practice, large companies often sign insurance policies on employees’ lives. The insurance company pays the annuity, and the company passes it to the employee.

---

### 2.2 Definitions

#### 2.2.1 Entry Age and Actuarial Age

- **Entry age $x_e$**: Actuarial age at the beginning of the year the employee joins.
- **Actuarial age**: Natural number, age at a fixed time point whose birthday is closest to that date.

  - Example: Born 01.04.2000, actuarial age at 31.12.2023 is 24 (since 01.04.2024 is closer than 01.04.2023).
  - If birth month $\leq 6$, $x_e = (\text{entry year}) - (\text{birth year})$
  - If birth month $> 6$, $x_e = (\text{entry year}) - (\text{birth year}) - 1$
  - Examples:
    - Born 28.03.1976, joined 05.07.2000: $x_e = 24$
    - Born 09.09.1976, joined 05.07.2000: $x_e = 23$

- **Special rule in Germany**: $x = \max\{\text{calculated entry age}, 25\}$ (persons under 25 not entitled to disability annuity).

#### 2.2.2 Retirement and Balance Age

- **Retirement age $z$**: Typically 65.
- **Number of remaining years until retirement**: $n = z - x$
- **Balance age $x + m$**: Actuarial age at the balance date (typically December 31st in Germany).

---

#### 2.2.3 Artificial Premium and Symbols

- **Yearly paid constant artificial premium $P_x$**:
  - Paid in advance: first at $x$, last at $z-1$ (beginning of retirement year).
  - No contract cancellation assumed.
  - $P_x = \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_{{x:n}\rceil}^a}$ (from the principle of equivalence; see below).
  - Double-lined $P_x$ denotes the insurance premium (to avoid confusion with survival probability).

- **$A_{x}$**: Expected present value at age $x$ of all future expected annuities (including retirement, disability, widow annuities).

---

### 2.3 Definition of Partial Value (Pension Reserve)

- **Prospective version**:
  - $${}_mV_x = A_{x+m} - P_x \cdot \ddot{a}_{{x+m:n-m}\rceil}^a$$
- **Interpretation**:
  - Difference between present value at balance age of all future payouts and present value of all remaining premium income.

- **Principle of equivalence**:
  - At entry age: $A_x = P_x \cdot \ddot{a}_{{x:n}\rceil}^a$
  - At contract start, expected present value of all future payouts equals expected present value of all future premiums.

---

#### 2.3.1 Retrospective Version

- $mV_x^{\text{retro}} = \frac{K + \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} {}_{k} P_{x} \cdot v^{k} \cdot (\mathbb{P}_x - {}_{k} L_{x})(1+i)}{_mp_x}$
- **Interpretation**: Sums up past differences of premium income and payouts, discounted appropriately.
- **Theorem**: $mV_x = mV_x^{\text{retro}}$ (prospective and retrospective versions are equal).

---

#### 2.3.2 Legal and Technical Remarks

- The definition of ${}_mV_x$ is given in §6a of the German Insurance Tax Law.
- The interest rate $i$ is defined as $i \geq 3.25\%$ p.a. (§6a), historically:
  - 1950–2016: $i = 6\%$
  - 2017–2019: $i = 4\%$
  - 2020 onward: $i = 3.25\%$
- **Reason for high $i$**:
  - To avoid moral hazard (companies using low $i$ would inflate present values and reserves, saving on taxes).
  - Discount factor: $v^k = \frac{1}{1 + i}$; lower $i$ means higher present value and higher reserves ($mV_x$).
- The above is called the **prospective version** of the partial value.

### 2.4 Example: Calculation of the Partial Value

#### 2.4.1 Pension Scheme Details

- **Company’s pension promise to employees**:
  - Retirement annuity: at age 65, €800/month, for life, paid in advance.
  - Disability annuity: monthly, in advance, for life. If disabled before 50, 85% of retirement annuity. For each year disabled after 50, add 1% per year (e.g., disabled at 53, get 88%).
  - Widow annuity: 60% of retirement annuity, monthly, in advance.

#### 2.4.2 Calculation Scenario

- Employee joined company at age 40 ($x = 40$).
- Calculate partial value 15 years later (i.e., at age 55, $m = 15$), assuming employee is still active.

#### 2.4.3 Formula

- $$_{15}V_{40} = A_{55} - \frac{A_{40}}{\ddot{a}_{{40:25}\rceil}^a} \cdot \ddot{a}_{{55:10}\rceil}^a$$

#### 2.4.4 Required Present Value Factors

- Factors such as $A_{55}$ and $A_{40}$ must be computed:
  - $A_{40}$: Present value at age 40 of all future expected retirement, disability, and widow annuity payments.
  - $A_{55}$: Similar, but at age 55.
- **Calculation for $A_{40}$**:
  - **Retirement annuity**: €800/month $\rightarrow$ €9,600/year, paid from 65, discounted from 40, considering survival probability.
    - $A_{40,\text{ret}} = 9,600 \cdot \frac{D_{65}}{D_{40}} \cdot A_{65}^R$
  - **Widow annuity**: 60% of €9,600, paid if employee dies, discounted appropriately.
    - $A_{40,\text{wid}} = 9,600 \cdot 0.6 \cdot A_{40}^{AW}$
  - **Disability annuity**: If disabled before 50, 85% of retirement annuity; for each year after 50, add 1% per year up to retirement age. Present value factors must account for this increasing percentage.
    - $A_{40,\text{dis}} = 9,600 \cdot [0.85 \cdot A_{40}^{AI} + \text{(additional terms for increases after 50)}]$

- **Similarly for $A_{55}$**; the percentages and discounting change according to age.

#### 2.4.5 Notes

- Non-mathematicians can determine yellow-highlighted present value factors from commutation lists.
- Only mathematicians are expected to accurately calculate $A_{x}$ at different ages, reflecting all annuity types and contingencies.

#### 2.4.6 Formula for Discounting

- $\frac{D_{65}}{D_{40}} = v^{25} \cdot {}_{25}p_{40}^a$
