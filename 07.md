## 1. Repetition and Definitions

### 1.1 Present Value Factor of an Annuity ($\ddot{a}_x$)

- $\ddot{a}_x := \sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x-1} { }_k p_x \cdot v^k$, $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq \omega}$
  - ${}_k p_x$: $k$-year surviving probability for an $x$-year-old.
  - $v$: Discount factor, $v := \frac{1}{1+i}$.
  - $i$: Interest rate per year (e.g., $3\%$ as $0.03$).
  - $k$: Index from $0$ to the theoretical end age ($\omega$).

- $\mathbb{E}(\ddot{a}_{N_{x}+1\rceil}) = \ddot{a}_x$
  - $N_x$: Discrete random variable, number of full years until death for an $x$-year-old.

- $\ddot{a}_{n\rceil} := \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} v^k$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$

#### 1.1.1 Interpretation of $\ddot{a}_x$

- Expected present value of a currently started, in-advance, yearly paid annuity of yearly amount $1$ (euro, USD, etc.) for an $x$-year-old person until end of life.
- $\ddot{a}_x$ is also called the **present value factor**.

#### 1.1.2 Application

- For annuity of €1,000 or €5,000 per year, multiply by $\ddot{a}_x$ to get present value.

#### 1.1.3 Yearly and Monthly Present Value Factors

- $(t)_{\ddot{a}_x}$: For $t \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$, "during the year" present value factor (e.g., monthly in Germany: $t=12$).
- $(1)_{\ddot{a}_x} = \ddot{a}_x$: Yearly present value factor.

#### 1.1.4 Theorem of Neuburger

- $\ddot{a}_x = (t)_{\ddot{a}_x} + k(t)$ for all age $x$.
- $k(t)$: Möberg/Neuburger's correction term, independent of age.

## 2. Commutation Symbols

### 2.1 Definitions

- $D_x^a := p_x^a \cdot v^x$, $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq Z-1}$, $Z = 67$ (retirement age).
- $D_x^i := p_x^i \cdot v^x$, $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq Z-1}$.
- $D_x^r := p_x^r \cdot v^x$, $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq Z} \cap \mathbb{N}_{<\omega}$.
- $D_x^w := p_x^w \cdot v^x$, $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 18} \cap \mathbb{N}_{<\omega}$.

#### 2.1.1 Sums of Commutation Symbols

- $N_x^a := \sum_{k=0}^{Z-x-1} D_{x+k}^a$
- $N_x^i := \sum_{k=0}^{Z-x-1} D_{x+k}^i$
- $N_x^r := \sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x-1} D_{x+k}^r$
- $N_x^w := \sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x-1} D_{x+k}^r$ (for widow annuities, first payment a year after the death of partner)

### 2.2 Interpretation of Commutation Symbols

- $\frac{D_{x+k}^a}{D_x^a} = { }_k p_x^a \cdot v^k$
- $\ddot{a}_x = \sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x-1} v^k \cdot { }_k p_x = \sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x-1} \frac{D_{x+k}}{D_x} = \frac{1}{D_x} \sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x-1} D_{x+k} = \frac{N_x}{D_x}$

## 3. Present Value Factors of Annuities

### 3.1 Overview

- No general formula for all present value factors; each is defined step-by-step.
- There are $14$–$16$ different present value factors, differentiated for various cases.
- These are allowed as a formulary in exams.

### 3.2 Computation Symbols' Sense

- Symbols simplify calculation of present value factors.
- Actuaries use tables of $D_x$ and $N_x$ for direct lookup.

---

## 4. Expected Present Value Factors (epvf) of Annuities

### 4.1 For Active Employees (Theoretical)

- $\ddot{a}_{x:Z-x\rceil}^a := \frac{N_x^a}{D_x^a} = \sum_{k=0}^{Z-x-1} { }_k p_x^a \cdot v^k$, for all $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq Z-1}$

#### 4.1.1 For Monthly Payments

- $(12)_{\ddot{a}_{x:Z-x\rceil}^a} = \ddot{a}_{x:Z-x\rceil}^a - k(t) \left(1 - \frac{D_{Z}^a}{D_x^a}\right)$

### 4.2 Disability Annuity Cut at Retirement Age $Z$

- $\ddot{a}_{x:Z-x\rceil}^i = \frac{N_x^i}{D_x^i}$
- For monthly payments: $(12)_{\ddot{a}_{x:Z-x\rceil}^i} = \ddot{a}_{x:Z-x\rceil}^i - k(t) \left(1 - \frac{D_{Z}^i}{D_x^i}\right)$

#### 4.2.1 In Germany: Two Types of Disability Annuity

- **Lifelong Disability Annuity**: Paid until end of life.
- **Cut Disability Annuity**: Paid only until retirement age $Z$; after $Z$ the person receives retirement annuity.

### 4.3 Retirement Annuity

- For all $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq Z}$: $\ddot{a}_x^r := \frac{N_x^r}{D_x^r}$

#### 4.3.1 For Monthly Payments

- $(12)_{\ddot{a}_x^r} = \ddot{a}_x^r - k(12)$ (Neuburger's theorem)

### 4.4 Deferred Retirement Annuity

#### 4.4.1 For Active Person

- Deferred: Waiting period of $Z - x$ years.
- For all $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq Z-1}$:
  - ${}_{z-x}\ddot{a}_x^{aA} := \frac{D_z^a}{D_x^a} \ddot{a}_z^r$
    - $\frac{D_z^a}{D_x^a} = {}_{z-x} p_x \cdot v^{z-x}$: Probability to survive from $x$ to $Z$ and discounting back.

#### 4.4.2 For Disabled Person

- ${}_{z-x}\ddot{a}_x^{iA} = \frac{D_z^i}{D_x^i} \ddot{a}_z^r$, $\forall x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq Z-1}$

### 4.5 Lifelong Disability Annuity

- $\ddot{a}_x^i := \ddot{a}_{x:Z-x\rceil}^{i} + {}_{z-x}\ddot{a}_x^{iA}$
- For monthly payments: $(12)_{\ddot{a}_x^i} = \ddot{a}_x^i - k(12)$

### 4.6 Widow Annuity

- $\ddot{a}_x^w := \frac{N_x^w}{D_x^w}$, $x \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 18} \cap \mathbb{N}_{<\omega}$
- For monthly payments: $(12)_{\ddot{a}_x^w} = \ddot{a}_x^w - k(12)$

## 5. Prospective Present Value Factors

### 5.1 Prospective Entitlement for Retired People (Widow Annuity)

- For all $x \geq Z$:
  - $\ddot{a}_x^{rw} := \frac{N_x^{rw}}{D_x^r}$
  - $N_x^{rw} := \sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x} D_{x+k}^{rw}$
  - $D_{x}^{rw} := D_x^r \cdot q_x^r \cdot h(x) \cdot \ddot{a}_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}^w \cdot v^{\frac{1}{2}}$

#### 5.1.1 Details

- $\ddot{a}_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}^w := {}_\frac{1}{2} p_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}^w \cdot \ddot{a}_{y(x)+1}^w \cdot v^{\frac{1}{2}}$
- $D_{x}^{rw} = D_x^r \cdot q_x^r \cdot h(x) \cdot {}_\frac{1}{2} p_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}}^w \cdot \ddot{a}_{y(x)+1}^w \cdot v$
- ${}_\frac{1}{2} p_{y(x)+\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1 - q_y^w(x)}{1 - \frac{1}{2} q_y^w(x)}$

#### 5.1.2 For Monthly Payments

- $(12)_{\ddot{a}_x^{rw}} = \ddot{a}_x^{rw} \quad (\text{since } k(t) = 0)$ (by Neuburger's invariance theorem)

#### 5.1.3 Explanation

- Retired person dies, is married at time of death, widow receives annuity.
- First payment for widow annuity occurs a year after the death of partner.
- Discounting and probability calculations use special mortality and marriage probability tables.

#### 5.1.4 Special Cases

- For half-year probabilities and discounting, use $v^{1/2}$ and ${}_\frac{1}{2}p$.
- This handles the situation where payment starts six months after death.

## 6. Invariance Theorem of Neuburger

### 6.1 Statement

- Present values of prospective annuities with stable yearly aggregate amounts and deterministic payout time points are independent of the payout order, if both the trigger event and the terminating event are uniformly distributed over the year.

#### 6.1.1 Implications

- In certain prospective cases, monthly and yearly defined present value factors are equal (correction term is zero).
- Applies to situations where start and end events are uniformly distributed (e.g., death, disability).

#### 6.1.2 Proof and Timeline

- To be proved in lecture unit 8.
- Timeline explanation: offset of intervals before and after annuity payouts results in same present value for both yearly and monthly cases.

## 7. Dynamical (Linearly Increasing) Annuities

### 7.1 Definition

- S-class commutation symbols ($S_x$) are introduced for dynamical annuities.
- A dynamical annuity increases linearly: in year 1, yearly aggregate is €1; in year 2, €2; etc.
- Each year, the annuity increases by €1 per year if the person survives.

## 8. Additional Notes

### 8.1 Calculation in Practice

- Actuaries use tables and computation symbols for practical calculation.
- Modern mathematicians may use Excel or software, but commutation symbols remain in actuarial education and exams.

### 8.2 Exercise Sheet

- Second exercise sheet with four exercises about present value factors of annuities.
