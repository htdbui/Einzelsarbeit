# Present Values of Pension Annuities

## 1. Types of Pension Annuities (German Context)
- Pension promises from companies comprise three kinds of annuities:
  - Retirement annuities
  - Disability annuities
  - Widow annuities
- In Germany, all three kinds of annuities are paid monthly at the beginning of each month.

---

## 2. Key Definitions

### 2.1. Present Value
- The present value of a future payment is the actual, current monetary amount needed to make certain payments in the future, taking into account the interest rate (also called the discount rate).
- **Example:**
  - Future payment: €1,000 in 24 years (2048).
  - Interest rate: 3% per year.
  - Present value calculation:
    - Formula: \( 1,000 \times \left(\frac{1}{1.03}\right)^{24} \approx 500 \)
    - Interpretation: Investing €500 today at 3% annual interest will grow to €1,000 in 24 years. The present value of €1,000 in 24 years is €500.

### 2.2. Discount Factor
- The discount factor is the factor used to calculate the present value of a future payment.
- Symbol: \( v \) (stands for "value").
- Formula: \( v := \frac{1}{1 + i} \)
  - \( i \) is the yearly interest rate (as a decimal, e.g., 3% as 0.03).
  - Note: \( i \) is not the complex number \( \sqrt{-1} \), but the interest rate.
- **During-the-year discount factor:**
  - Formula: \( v^{(\frac{\mu}{t})} := \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\mu}{t}i} \)
    - \( t \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2} \) (number of installments per year)
    - \( \mu \in \{0, 1, ..., t-1\} \)
    - Example: If \( t = 12 \), it means monthly consideration.
    - \( t \) describes the number of installments during the year. \( t = 12 \) means monthly, \( t = 4 \) quarterly, etc.
    - \( \mu \in \mathbb{N}_{<t-1} \cup \{0\} \)

---

## 3. Axioms and Payment Timing

### 3.1. Axiom 1: Linear Interest Calculation During the Year
- Interest calculation is defined linearly during the year by financial institutions.
- The discount factor for within-year installments is \( \frac{1}{(1 + \frac{\mu}{t})^t} \).
- \( t \) is the number of installments in a year; \( \mu \) indexes the installment; \( t = 12 \) for monthly.

### 3.2. Axiom 2: Timing of Annuity Payments
- Annuity payments are made at deterministical (deterministic) time points, either:
  - At the beginning of each time interval (in advance), or
  - At the end of each time interval.
- The time intervals are equidistant (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or yearly).
- In Germany, all annuities are paid monthly at the beginning of each month.

---

## 4. Present Value Factors and Symbols

### 4.1. Technical Terms and Notation
- **Annuity:** A series of regular or frequent money payments. The time intervals between payments must be equal (equidistant).
- **Present Value Factors:**
  - \( \ddot{a}_{n\rceil} := \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} v^k = 1 + v + v^2 + \cdots + v^{n-1} \)
    - Present value of a yearly paid annuity in advance (at the beginning of each time interval) of 1€ for the next \( n-1 \) years, starting now.
    - If invested today, will provide 1€ per year for each of the next \( n-1 \) years, starting immediately.
  - \( a_{n\rceil} := \sum_{k=0}^{n} v^k \)
    - Present value of a yearly paid annuity at the end of each time interval.
  - Both are called present value factors.

### 4.2. Interpretation
- \( \ddot{a}_{n\rceil} \):
  - Present value of a yearly paid annuity in advance (at the beginning of each period) of 1€ for \( n-1 \) years.
- \( a_{n\rceil} \):
  - Present value of a yearly paid annuity at the end of each period for \( n \) years.

### 4.3. Assumption for Aggregate Payouts
- The aggregate payouts of a pension annuity are standardized to 1€ (without loss of generality).
- For monthly payouts: 1/12€ paid at the beginning of each month.

## 5. Present Value of Lifelong Annuities

### 5.1. Lifelong Annuity for Age \( x \)
- For all ages \( x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq \omega = 121} \):
  - \( \ddot{a}_x := \sum_{k=0}^{\omega - x - 1} {}_k p_x \cdot v^k \)
    - \( {}_k p_x \) is the probability an \( x \)-year-old survives \( k \) years.
    - \( v^k \) discounts the payment \( k \) years into the future.
    - The sum runs up to \( \omega - x - 1 \), where \( \omega \) is the theoretical maximum age (e.g., 121).

### 5.2. Lifelong Annuity as a Random Variable
- Let \( N_x \) be a random variable modeling the number of full years until death for an \( x \)-year-old.
- Then:
  - \( \mathbb{E}(\ddot{a}_{N_x+1\rceil}) = \sum_{k=0}^{\omega - x - 1} {}_k p_x \cdot v^k \)
    - Proof uses the double-sum theorem and properties of indicator functions.

#### Proof Steps:
- \( \mathbb{E}(\ddot{a}_{N+1\rceil}) = \sum_{k \geq 0} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{k} v^j \right) \mathbb{P}(N_x = k) \)
- By double-sum theorem:
  - \( = \sum_{j \geq 0} v^j \sum_{k \geq 0} \mathbb{1}_{\{j \leq k\}} \mathbb{P}(N_x = k) \)
  - \( = \sum_{j \geq 0} v^j \mathbb{P}(N_x \geq j) = \sum_{j \geq 0} v^j {}_j p_x \)

#### Proof Remarks:
1. If \( A \) is a sigma field element, then \( \mathbb{1}_A \) is a random variable.
   - \( \mathbb{1}_A(\omega) = 0 \) if \( \omega \not\in A \), \( 1 \) if \( \omega \in A \)
   - \( A \subseteq \Omega \), \( \sigma \subseteq \Omega \)
2. \( \sum_{k \geq j} \mathbb{P}(N_x = k) = \mathbb{P}(N_x \geq j) \), the probability that an \( x \)-year-old survives at least \( j \) more years.

### 5.3. Interpretation of \( \ddot{a}_x \)
- It is the expected present value of a yearly paid (in advance) lifelong annuity of 1€ for an \( x \)-year-old person, starting now.
- For a yearly annuity payout of \( R \)€, the present value is \( R \ddot{a}_x \).
- \( \ddot{a}_x \) is called the present value factor.

## 6. Present Value Factor for During-the-Year (Installment) Payments

### 6.1. Motivation for "During-the-Year" Factor
- In Germany, pension annuities are paid monthly, but the above formulas are defined yearly.
- Need to introduce a "during-the-year" present value factor to accurately reflect payment schedules.

### 6.2. Definition of During-the-Year Present Value Factor
- \( (t)_{\ddot{a}_x} \): for \( t \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2} \) (number of installments per year)
  - If \( t = 12 \): monthly payouts.
  - If \( t = 4 \): quarterly payouts.
  - If \( t = 365 \): daily payouts.
- At each period, \( 1/t \)€ is paid out in advance until the end of life for an \( x \)-year-old person.

- Formula:
  - \( (t)_{\ddot{a}_x} := \sum_{k=0}^{\omega - x - 1} v^k \cdot {}_k p_x \cdot (t)_{\ddot{a}_{x+k:1\rceil}} \)
  - Where \( (t)_{\ddot{a}_{x:1\rceil}} := \frac{1}{t} \sum_{\mu=0}^{t-1} v^{(\frac{\mu}{t})} \cdot {}_{\frac{\mu}{t}} p_x \)
    - \( \frac{1}{t} \) is the euro amount of the payout per period.
    - The sum \( \sum_{\mu=0}^{t-1} v^{(\frac{\mu}{t})} \cdot {}_{\frac{\mu}{t}} p_x \) is the present value factor for one year only.
    - \( :1 \) denotes "at most the next year".

## 7. Main Theorem of Neuburger

### 7.1. Statement of the Main Theorem
- For all ages \( x \in \mathbb{N}_{\leq \omega} \) and \( t \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2} \):
  - \( \ddot{a}_x = (t)_{\ddot{a}_x} + k(t) \)
  - \( k(t) := \frac{1 + i}{t} \sum_{\mu=0}^{t-1} \frac{\mu}{t + i\mu} \)
- The theorem states that the yearly defined present value factor equals the during-the-year defined present value factor plus a "correction term" \( k(t) \).

### 7.2. Properties and Remarks
1. \( k(t) \) is called the correction term, denoted \( K \) (German: "Korrektur").
2. \( k(t) \) is independent of age \( x \).
3. Before Neuburger's theorem (1995), pension actuaries used approximation formulas for this adjustment.
4. The yearly defined present value factor is always larger than or equal to the during-the-year defined present value factor.
   - Reason: In the yearly case, the full annuity is paid at the beginning of the year of death, while in the monthly case, only a portion (e.g., 1/12) is paid at the beginning of the month of death.

---

## 8. Proofs and Lemmas Related to the Main Theorem

### 8.1. Lemma 1: Alternative Expression for the Correction Term
- \( k(t) = 1 - \frac{1 + i}{t} \sum_{\mu=0}^{t-1} \frac{t - \mu}{t + i\mu} \)

#### Proof Outline:
- \( 1 - k(t) = 1 - \frac{1 + i}{t} \sum_{\mu=0}^{t-1} \frac{\mu}{t + i\mu} \)
- This can be written as:
  - \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{\mu=0}^{t-1} \frac{t + i\mu - (1 + i)\mu}{t + i\mu} \)

### 8.2. Lemma 2: Present Value Factor for One Year
- \( (t)\ddot{a}_{x:1} = 1 - k(t)(1 - v p_x) \) with \( v = \frac{1}{1 + i} \)

#### Proof Outline:
- \( 1 - k(t)(1 - v p_x) = 1 - k(t) + k(t) v p_x \)
- The contribution of the present value factor for only one year is shown using the survival probability and the discount factor.

### 8.3. Main Proof of Neuburger's Theorem

#### Steps:
1. Start with the definition:
   - \( (t)_{\ddot{a}_x} = \sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x-1} v^k {}_k p_x (t)_{\ddot{a}_{x+k:1\rceil}} \)
2. Use Lemma 2 for \( (t)_{\ddot{a}_{x+k:1\rceil}} \):
   - \( (t)_{\ddot{a}_{x+k:1\rceil}} = 1 - k(t)(1 - v p_{x+k}) \)
3. Expand:
   - \( (t)_{\ddot{a}_x} = \sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x-1} v^k {}_k p_x (1 - k(t))(1 - v p_{x+k}) \)
4. This leads to:
   - \( \ddot{a}_x - k(t) [\sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x-1} v^k {}_k p_x - \sum_{k=0}^{\omega-x-1} v^{k+1} {}_{k+1} p_x] \)
5. By index shifting:
   - \( = \ddot{a}_x - k(t) (v^0 {}_0 p_x - v^{\omega-x} {}_{\omega-x} p_x) \)
   - \( = \ddot{a}_x - k(t) (1 - 0) \)
   - \( = \ddot{a}_x - k(t) \)
6. Therefore:
   - \( \ddot{a}_x = (t)_{\ddot{a}_x} + k(t) \)

## 9. Practical Implications for Pension Companies
- Pension companies have to calculate pension reserves for future payments.
  - In Germany, companies pay approximately 30% tax on profits annually.
  - Pension promises allow companies to set aside reserves for future payouts, reducing taxable income.
- Accurate calculation of pension reserves relies on present value factors and correct application of the during-the-year adjustments.

---

## 10. Final Remarks
- The discount factor \( v \) and present value factors like \( \ddot{a}_x \), \( (t)_{\ddot{a}_x} \), and the correction term \( k(t) \) are central to the mathematical foundation of pension annuity valuation.
- The precise relationships and definitions allow actuaries to model pension payment obligations accurately, whether paid annually, monthly, quarterly, or daily.
- Neuburger's theorem established the exact relationship between yearly and installment-based valuation—before which only approximations were used.
- The correction term is strictly a function of the number of installments per year and the interest rate, not of the age or other properties of the annuitant.
